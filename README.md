## About the Project

**Assign Watch** is a browser extension designed for [LEB2](https://www.leb2.org/what-is-leb2), an educational platform developed by [King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT)](https://www.kmutt.ac.th).

### The Problem

By default, LEB2 requires students to navigate individual class pages to view assignments, making it time-consuming to get a complete overview of your workload.

### The Solution

Assign Watch aggregates all your assignments across courses, providing instant visibility into your academic commitments with an intuitive, feature-rich interface.

## Features

- **Unified Dashboard:** View all assignments across courses in one place.
- **Calendar View:** Visualize your workload with an interactive weekly or monthly calendar.
- **Notifications:** Get timely alerts for assignments that are due soon.
- **Customizable View:** Hide or show classes or assignments you don't want to see.
- **Quick Access:** Instantly open with keyboard shortcut (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> or <kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd>).
- **Multi-language Support:** Available in English and Thai.

### Manual Installation

#### Prerequisites

Download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/thrxpt/assign-watch/releases) page and extract the archive.

#### For Chrome

1. Navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable **Developer mode** in the top-right corner.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the extracted folder.

#### For Firefox

1. Navigate to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on**.
3. Select the `manifest.json` file inside the extracted folder.

> [!WARNING]
>
> **Firefox Limitation:** Extensions installed via "Load Temporary Add-on" will be removed when you close or restart Firefox. For permanent usage, please install via the Firefox Add-ons store link above.

#### For Safari

1. Install Xcode and its command-line tools.
2. Run `pnpm build:safari` (or extract `.output/assign-watch-*-safari.zip` or `.output/safari-mv2`).
3. Package the extension into a native Safari extension app using Apple's packager CLI tool:
   ```bash
   xcrun safari-web-extension-packager .output/safari-mv2 \
     --app-name "Assign Watch" \
     --bundle-identifier "org.leb2.Assign-Watch" \
     --macos-only --no-open --no-prompt --force \
     --project-location .output/safari-xcode
   ```
4. Build the native macOS wrapper with `pnpm build:safari:app`. This packages the extension into `.output/safari-xcode` and builds the Xcode project into `.output/safari-derived`. If you prefer, open `.output/safari-xcode/Assign Watch/Assign Watch.xcodeproj`, select a development team, and run the **Assign Watch** macOS app target.
5. Enable **Assign Watch** under **Safari > Settings > Extensions**.
6. Grant the extension access to `app.leb2.org` when Safari asks for website access.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Safari extensions require a native macOS/iOS app wrapper created via Xcode CLI (`safari-web-extension-packager`). See the [WXT Safari Guide](https://wxt.dev/guide/essentials/publishing.html#safari) and [Apple's packaging guide](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/packaging-a-web-extension-for-safari) for details.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Safari does not support the WebExtension `notifications` API used by Assign Watch. Safari builds omit that permission, and the background script continues without notification listeners or due-soon alerts. Chrome and Firefox retain browser notifications.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> GitHub Actions builds an **unsigned Release app** for build validation only. These artifacts are not signed or notarized for end-user installation. Tagged releases include the Safari web-extension ZIP, which requires packaging with Xcode; they do not include a distributable native Safari app. App Store distribution requires Apple Developer signing and submission through App Store Connect. For a local signed build, open the generated Xcode project, choose your development team for both app and extension targets, and build from Xcode. Re-running the packaging command regenerates the project and replaces its signing settings.
